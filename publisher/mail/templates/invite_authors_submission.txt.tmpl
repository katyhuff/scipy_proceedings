Dear {{name}},

For the third time, the SciPy conference will publish proceedings. In
relation to your contribution "{{ title }}" we are glad to invite your
contribution to the conference proceedings. The submission deadline is
September, 20th.

The proceeding papers have to be submitted to
https://github.com/scipy-conference/scipy_proceedings where you will find
complete instructions. Git-aware contributors can follow the summary:

• Fork https://github.com/scipy-conference/scipy_proceedings
• Clone the fork: git clone
git@github.com:GITHUBLOGIN/scipy_proceedings
• Write your paper in papers/lastname.rst
• Commit and push it: git add papers/lastname.rst  ; git commit -m "My
paper" ;
git push origin master
• Create the pull request on github and wait for feedback. Please name the
pull request as follow: "Paper: The title of my paper (Name of first author)"

Contributors unfamiliar with git are advised to follow the tutorial at
http://git-lectures.github.io/

Paper format
------------

Papers are formatted using reStructuredText and the compiled version should be
no longer than 7 pages, including figures. We do not support papers written in
latex or in word format. An example paper is provided in papers/00_vanderwalt.

1. Fork the scipy_proceedings repository on GitHub.
2. An example paper is provided in papers/00_vanderwalt. Create a new
   directory papers/firstname_surname, copy the example paper into it, and
   modify to your liking.
3. Run ./make_paper.sh papers/firstname_surname to compile your paper to PDF
   (requires LaTeX, docutils, Python--see below). The output appears in
   output/firstname_surname/paper.pdf.
4. Once you are ready to submit your paper, file a pull request on GitHub. The
   pull request title must include the paper title and the name of the first
   author as follows: "Paper: The title of my paper (Name of first author)"
5. Pull requests are to be submitted by September 20th, but modifications are
   allowed during the review period.


Please do not modify any files outside of your paper directory.

General guidelines
------------------

1. Papers must be clearly and concisely written in English and within the
   recommended length. In the interests of speed, manuscripts are not
   extensively copyedited and authors are requested to check their texts
   carefully for grammar and spelling mistakes.
2. All figures and tables should have captions.
3. License conditions on images and figures must be respected (Creative
   Commons, etc.).
4. Code snippets should be formatted to fit inside a single column without
   overflow.
5. Avoid custom LaTeX markup where possible.

The proceedings will be published on the arxiv.org platform as a conference
collection, for which the editors will provide a table of content listing the
contributions in the collection. The 2013 proceedings followed the same method
and can be seen at http://arxiv.org/html/1405.0166v1

With best regards,
